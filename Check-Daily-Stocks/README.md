# Checking Daily Stocks

### Description
This project will go and check the current value of the following stocks:
- S&P 500
- Dow Jones
- Nasdaq

Along with checking these current stock values, screenshots are taken of stocks current summary page and current chart page. Pleaes note that you will have to edit the location of where the images get saved.

This script has these three stocks as a proof-of-concept. The script can easily be edited/cut-down to see a stock that you are interested in, rather than going through these three specific stocks.

Please see the overall Selenium-Tests repository README.md on properly setting up your Eclipse IDE to run this project.
